  - name: incremental_filter_by_id_and_recent_date
    description: >
      Adds incremental filter logic for models that use an increasing ID column and a creation date column.
      This macro is designed to be used in incremental dbt models. 

      If the model is running incrementally (not a full refresh), it applies:
        1. A filter to include only rows where the ID is greater than the maximum ID already present in the target table.
        2. A filter to include only rows from the last `n` months based on a date column (default is 12 months).

      This macro helps reduce the amount of data processed on each run while ensuring late-arriving data within the recent months is still captured.

    arguments:
      - name: id_column
        type: string
        description: The name of the incremental ID column, typically a unique and increasing identifier like `post_id`.

      - name: date_column
        type: string
        description: The name of the column containing the date used to filter recent rows (e.g., `creation_date`).

      - name: months
        type: integer
        description: Number of months of recent data to include in the filter window. Default is 12.

      - name: table
        type: string (optional)
        description: Optional. A dbt reference or table name to compare against. If not provided, defaults to the current model (`this`).
